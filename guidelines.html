                   <p class="lead">These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:
                    </p>

            <li>Background</li>

                   <li> Race and/or ethnicity</li>
                    <li>National origin</li>
                   <li>Socioeconomic status</li>
                 <li>Religion</li>

                  <li>Any other dimension of diversity
                    </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p class="lead">Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work — from learning offline at meetups to collaboratively working online via community channel. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.
                        </p>
                        <h3>When and How to Use These Guidelines
                          </h3>
                          <p class="lead">These guidelines outline our behavior expectations as members of the School of AI Kochi community in all Mozilla activities, both offline and online. Your participation is contingent upon following these guidelines in all SoAI Kochi activities.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Expected Behavior</h3>  
                            <p class="lead">The following behaviors are expected of all members: </p>
                            <h4>Be Respectful</h4>
                            <p class="lead">Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be kind in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.
                              </p>
                            <h4>Be Direct but Professional</h4>
                            <p class="lead">We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.
                              </p>
                              <h4>Be Inclusive</h4>
                              <p class="lead">Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.
                                  Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:
                                  </p>
                                 <p class="lead"></p>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>Remote (on video or phone)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Not native language speakers</li>
                                     <li>Coming from a different culture
                                      </li>
                                      <li>Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”
                                        </li>
                                       <li>Living in a different time zone
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Facing other challenges to participate
                                          </li>
                                      </ul>
                                       <p class="lead">Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.
                                        </p>
                              <h4>Understand Different Perspectives </h4>
                              <p class="lead">Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.
                                </p>
                              <h4>Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences  </h4>
                              <p class="lead">We come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect Mozillians to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.
                                </p>
                              <h4>Lead by Example </h4>
                              <p class="lead">By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for School of AI mission.
                                </p>
                            <h3>Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated  </h3>
                            <p class="lead">The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.
                              </p>
                              <h4>Violence and Threats of Violence</h4>
                              <p class="lead">Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.
                                </p>
                              <h4>Personal Attacks </h4>
                              <p class="lead">Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Derogatory Language</h4>

                                      </p>
                                      <h4>Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact
                                        </h4>
                                      <p class="lead">Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances.

This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.
